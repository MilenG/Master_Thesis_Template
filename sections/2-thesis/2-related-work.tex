\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related_work}
% Your work needs to be grounded and compared to earlier work and the state-of-the-art. Start the section by announcing the research gap, and also end with the research gap. Consider using hypotheses. 
Write about your related work here. Make clear to which key papers you will compare your eventual results to. This can be done from the perspective of the methods used, the task at hand, and the addressed domain.

% The related work section is not a background section. If you want to explain techniques, it is possible to have a background section after the Related Work section. Background should only be added when it has a benefit for an informed audience. It is not common to use a background section.
